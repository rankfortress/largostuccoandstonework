Stucco is a prime choice when looking to increase the aesthetic appeal and value of your property. So choosing a team like ours is very important. With over 25 years experience and knowledge in the industry, you know you can’t go wrong.Stucco is an exterior finish that is applied over a framework of wood, metal or concrete. A stucco exterior can be made from either Portland cement-based material or natural materials such as lime and sand.A traditional stucco finish has three main components: an inner layer to provide strength, the aggregate for texture and bulk, and the finishing coat, which provides color.
	
	Natural stucco is water-resistant; it has a more natural look than traditional stucco finishes because of its texture and coloring; however, this finish may require maintenance to keep it from cracking or deteriorating over time.Modern Stucco products are made by applying cement plaster coating, which is then textured with a fine aggregate and reinforced with mesh. This finish presents an attractive, durable exterior that does not need to be painted or stained.Traditional stucco was made using lime as the binder of sand and water; this mixture could take months to dry out before work on another layer would begin. Modern stucco is a much quicker process, taking about one week to dry. Stucco is a type of cement that has an aesthetic texture and will survive in all kinds of weather.Applying stucco needs a professional to ensure a quality installation with precision and detail.  Our team of professionals can install your new home’s exterior, or help to restore the beauty of an old one. Clearwater Stucco and Stonework has many years of experience installing both traditional and modern materials, so they know what it takes to make a house look fabulous.
